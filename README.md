# Bakery-monthly-sales-target-analysis
Our project's focus is to explore the performance of three specific sales outlets: Outlet 3, Outlet 5, and Outlet 8, during the month of April 2019. We aim to understand how these outlets performed in terms of sales. Additionally, our goal is to analyze how clients were distributed among generation categories.
